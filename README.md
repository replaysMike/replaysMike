Hello there, Iâ€™m @replaysMike

I'm a full-stack developer, software architect and Iâ€™m interested mostly in C# and C embedded development - though I dabble a lot.

One of my biggest projects is [360 Replays](http://360replays.com) where I designed and built a huge moving camera array.

Iâ€™m currently learning _all the things!_ Lots of experience with security, design and crypto I'm always building _something_.
